echo "🔧 Testing Enhanced Background Location Tracking Fix"
echo "=================================================="

echo ""
echo "📱 BACKGROUND TRACKING ISSUE DIAGNOSED:"
echo "======================================="
echo "❌ PROBLEM: Service workers cannot access navigator.geolocation"
echo "❌ ISSUE: GPS tracking stops when switching tabs/apps"
echo "❌ CAUSE: Wrong architecture - service worker tried to get GPS directly"
echo ""

echo "✅ SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:"
echo "======================="
echo "✅ Enhanced Background Manager with Wake Lock API"
echo "✅ Continuous foreground GPS tracking (doesn't stop)"
echo "✅ Service worker only handles data persistence"
echo "✅ Wake lock prevents device sleep during tracking"
echo "✅ Visibility API handling for tab switches"
echo ""

echo "🧪 TESTING STEPS:"
echo "================"
echo ""

echo "Step 1: Open Driver Dashboard"
echo "- Go to: http://localhost:3000/login/driver"
echo "- Login with any driver credentials"
echo "- Check console for: '🚀 Starting ENHANCED background location tracking'"
echo ""

echo "Step 2: Verify Enhanced Tracking"
echo "- Open browser console (F12)"
echo "- Look for: '✅ Enhanced GPS tracking active'"
echo "- Look for: '🔒 Wake lock acquired'"
echo "- Look for: '📍 GPS Update' messages every 8 seconds"
echo ""

echo "Step 3: Test Tab Switching (Critical Test)"
echo "- Open a new tab while GPS is tracking"
echo "- Switch to the new tab for 30+ seconds"
echo "- Return to driver dashboard tab"
echo "- Check console - GPS updates should have continued"
echo "- Students should still see live location"
echo ""

echo "Step 4: Test App Switching (Mobile)"
echo "- If on mobile, switch to another app"
echo "- Wait 30+ seconds"
echo "- Return to browser"
echo "- Location should still be updating"
echo ""

echo "📊 SUCCESS INDICATORS:"
echo "====================="
echo "✅ Console shows GPS updates every 8 seconds"
echo "✅ 'Wake lock acquired' message appears"
echo "✅ Location continues updating when tab is hidden"
echo "✅ Students see real-time location on their dashboard"
echo "✅ No 'GPS tracking stopped' errors"
echo ""

echo "🔍 DEBUG COMMANDS (Run in Browser Console):"
echo "==========================================="
echo ""
echo "Check Enhanced Tracking Status:"
echo "window.EnhancedBackgroundLocationManager?.getTrackingStatus()"
echo ""
echo "Check Wake Lock Status:"
echo "navigator.wakeLock?.request('screen').then(() => console.log('✅ Wake lock works'))"
echo ""
echo "Force Location Update:"
echo "navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(pos => console.log('📍 GPS:', pos.coords))"
echo ""
echo "Check Service Worker:"
echo "navigator.serviceWorker.getRegistrations().then(regs => console.log('📝 SW:', regs))"
echo ""

echo "🎯 KEY DIFFERENCES FROM OLD SYSTEM:"
echo "==================================="
echo "OLD: ❌ Service worker tried to access GPS (impossible)"
echo "NEW: ✅ Foreground GPS + Service worker data persistence"
echo ""
echo "OLD: ❌ GPS stopped when tab hidden"
echo "NEW: ✅ Wake lock + visibility handling keeps GPS active"
echo ""
echo "OLD: ❌ Tracking died on app switch"
echo "NEW: ✅ Enhanced event handling maintains tracking"
echo ""

echo "🚀 Ready to test! Open the driver dashboard and try switching tabs."

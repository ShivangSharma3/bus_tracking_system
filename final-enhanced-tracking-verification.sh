echo "1. Open: http://localhost:3002"
echo "2. Check browser console for these logs:"
echo "   • 🔧 Initializing Enhanced Background Location Manager"
echo "   • 🔄 Service Worker registered for background GPS tracking"
echo "   • ✅ Enhanced Background Location Manager initialized successfully"
echo ""
echo "3. Go to Driver Login: http://localhost:3002/login/driver"
echo "4. Login with: D001 / driver123"
echo "5. Verify GPS tracking starts automatically"
echo "6. Test background continuity:"
echo "   • Switch to another app for 2+ minutes"
echo "   • Check student dashboard for continued updates"
echo "   • Return to driver app - tracking should be seamless"

echo "✅ Service worker registers automatically"
echo "✅ Background tracking starts on driver login"
echo "✅ GPS tracking continues when switching apps"
echo "✅ Location updates persist in localStorage"
echo "✅ Students see real-time bus location"
echo "✅ Auto-resume after browser restart"

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Files Modified:
1. **`/src/pages/StudentDashboard.jsx`**
   - Added attendance tab to navigation
   - Implemented attendance data loading logic
   - Created monthly attendance display components

2. **`/src/utils/attendanceDB.js`**
   - Added `getStudentAttendance(rollNo)` method
   - Added `getStudentAttendanceByMonth(rollNo, year, month)` method

### Data Structure:
The attendance records are fetched from the existing AttendanceDB system that drivers use to submit attendance. Each record contains:
- Student roll number and attendance status
- Date, time, and trip type
- Driver information
- Bus and route details

## 🧪 How to Test

```bash
npm run dev
# Opens at http://localhost:5174/

1. Open browser console (F12 → Console)
2. Copy and paste the contents of `load-attendance-data.js`
3. Press Enter to load sample attendance data

### Step 3: Login as Student

### Step 4: Test the Attendance Tab
1. Click on **"📊 My Attendance"** tab
2. Check the attendance summary cards
3. Select different months (August vs September 2025)
4. Verify records show correctly

### Expected Results:
- **August 2025**: 3 attendance records (2 present, 1 absent)
- **September 2025**: 1 attendance record (1 present)
- **Attendance Percentage**: Calculated correctly based on present/total

## 📱 Sample Data Included

The test data includes:

### Records List

## 🔄 Real-World Integration

This feature integrates seamlessly with the existing system:

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

Potential improvements that could be added:

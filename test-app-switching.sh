echo "🎯 TESTING SCENARIO: Driver App Switching"
echo "========================================="

echo ""
echo "📱 Step 1: Start the Bus Tracking System"
echo "---------------------------------------"
echo "1. Open terminal and run: npm run dev"
echo "2. Open browser to: http://localhost:3002"
echo "3. Go to Driver Login: /login/driver"
echo "4. Login with credentials: D001 / driver123"

echo ""
echo "📡 Step 2: Verify Initial GPS Tracking"
echo "-------------------------------------"
echo "1. Check console for these logs:"
echo "   ✅ '🔧 Initializing Enhanced Background Location Manager'"
echo "   ✅ '🔄 Service Worker registered for background GPS tracking'"
echo "   ✅ '🚀 Starting ENHANCED GPS tracking with continuous background support'"
echo "2. Grant location permissions when prompted"
echo "3. Verify GPS coordinates appear in driver dashboard"

echo ""
echo "🚀 Step 3: Test Aggressive Background Mode"
echo "==========================================="
echo "1. Keep Developer Tools console open"
echo "2. Minimize the browser window OR switch to another app"
echo "3. Look for these console logs:"
echo "   ✅ '📱 App went to background - Enhanced tracking ensures continuity'"
echo "   ✅ '🚀 Activating aggressive background tracking mode'"
echo "   ✅ '📍 Aggressive SW tracking (3s interval)'"
echo "   ✅ '📍 Aggressive Web Worker location'"
echo "   ✅ '📍 Persistent background location'"

echo ""
echo "⏱️ Step 4: Verify Continuous Tracking"
echo "======================================"
echo "1. Stay in other app for 2-3 minutes"
echo "2. Open Student Dashboard on another device/tab:"
echo "   - Go to: http://localhost:3002/login/student"
echo "   - Login with: 2022001 / student123"
echo "   - Check if bus location is updating every 2-3 seconds"
echo "3. Location should continue updating even while driver app is minimized"

echo ""
echo "🔄 Step 5: Test Return to Foreground"
echo "===================================="
echo "1. Return to driver dashboard browser window"
echo "2. Look for these console logs:"
echo "   ✅ '📱 Window focus - App regaining focus, verifying tracking'"
echo "   ✅ '👀 App came to foreground - Verifying background tracking status'"
echo "3. Tracking should continue seamlessly"

echo ""
echo "📊 Expected Results:"
echo "==================="
echo "✅ GPS updates continue when driver app is minimized"
echo "✅ Student dashboard shows real-time location updates"
echo "✅ Tracking intervals become more aggressive (2-3 seconds)"
echo "✅ Multiple tracking methods activate (Service Worker + Web Worker + Persistent)"
echo "✅ Location data persists in localStorage"
echo "✅ No interruption when returning to foreground"

echo ""
echo "🔧 Troubleshooting:"
echo "=================="
echo "If tracking stops when switching apps:"
echo "1. Check browser console for errors"
echo "2. Verify location permissions are granted"
echo "3. Check if Service Worker is registered:"
echo "   - Open DevTools → Application → Service Workers"
echo "   - Look for 'sw-location.js'"
echo "4. Test in different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)"

echo ""
echo "📱 Mobile Testing:"
echo "=================="
echo "1. Open the app on mobile browser"
echo "2. Login as driver and start GPS tracking"
echo "3. Switch to other mobile apps (WhatsApp, Maps, etc.)"
echo "4. Check student dashboard from another device"
echo "5. Location should continue updating even on mobile"

echo ""
echo "🧪 Advanced Testing Commands:"
echo "============================="
echo ""
echo "# Test Service Worker status:"
echo "navigator.serviceWorker.getRegistrations().then(regs => console.log(regs))"
echo ""
echo "# Check aggressive mode status:"
echo "console.log(localStorage.getItem('aggressiveBackgroundMode'))"
echo ""
echo "# Manual GPS test:"
echo "navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(pos => console.log(pos), err => console.error(err))"
echo ""
echo "# Check stored location:"
echo "console.log(localStorage.getItem('latest_location_66d0123456a1b2c3d4e5f601'))"

echo ""
echo "🎉 SUCCESS CRITERIA:"
echo "===================="
echo "✅ Location updates persist when driver switches apps"
echo "✅ Students see continuous real-time bus location"
echo "✅ No GPS gaps or interruptions"
echo "✅ Aggressive mode activates automatically"
echo "✅ Multiple fallback systems work"
echo "✅ Cross-device synchronization maintains"

echo ""
echo "🚌 READY TO TEST ENHANCED BACKGROUND TRACKING!"
echo "==============================================="
echo ""
echo "The system now provides truly uninterrupted GPS tracking"
echo "that works even when drivers use other apps! 📱📍✨"
